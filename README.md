# PET Colonies 64 for the Commodore 64/128 and compatibles

This is based on "Star Colony", by Tim Hartnell, originally published in "The Easy Way To Program Your New Computer [Works with all microcomputers]", published in 1984 by Interface Publications.

Star Colony is subsequently based on [John Conway's Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ "Game of Life")

I'm not sure how 'true' it is to the original concept, and you should note that even the readable listing is much different to the one in the book mentioned above. I've put it here as I wasn't allowed to upload the disk image containing the executables to some social media sites. So, get CBM PRG Studio and build it yourself.

This should work in 128 mode, though I've not tested yet.
